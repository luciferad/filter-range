## 1.5.5: Filter range

This is solution to the filter range challenge on Javascript.info.
Part 1, chapter 2, heading 2, exercise 2, filter range

## Description

This function gets an array and two numbers (a, b). It returns a new array which contains values higher or equal to 'a' & lower or equal to 'b'.

## My Process

First of all I solve the challenge based on what I've learned from javascript.info & then I try to improve my code. Finally I write code according to the javascript.info solution.
